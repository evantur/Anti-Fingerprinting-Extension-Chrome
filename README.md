**Manifest File**
The manifest.json file contains the name and description of the extension, manifest_version must be set to 3 for chrome.

**Sandbox File**
The sandbox.js file injects your script before a webpage loads, because if it loads after the webpage the extension won't work!

**Disguise File**
The mitochondria of the extension, this file is split up into sections that randomize different values that sites would collect. Having the values memorized means these sites wouldn't be able to recognize your computer upon future visits.
